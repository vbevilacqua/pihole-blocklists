# pihole-blocklists

This is a compilation of all the sources that I use to setup my pihole.

## List of sources

The Big Blocklist Collection
https://firebog.net/

The EasyList filter lists are sets of rules originally designed for Adblock that automatically remove unwanted content from the internet, including annoying adverts, bothersome banners and troublesome tracking.

## If you are up for a challenge

This is a custom regex filter file for use with Pi-hole v4+ (FTLDNS). The purpose of this list is to compliment your existing blocklists using powerful regular expressions that can cover a very broad range of domains.

## I haven't tried yet but seems interesting


This script tries to provide you with a bunch of information that enables you to decide which adlists you need based on your browsing behavior.

## To keep your pihole up to date


When using remote lists like this or this it's a hassle to manually check for changes and update - this script will do that for you! User-created entries will not be touched and those removed from the remote list will be disabled instead.

## Something that you need got blocked?

A robust collection of commonly white listed websites borrowed from various sources including Pi-Hole subreddit, Pi-Hole forum, Pi-Hole GitHub repository and more!

## For the lazy ones :D 

Three simple scripts written with the intent to be run by a cron job scheduler.
